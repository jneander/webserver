# webserver

This is an exercise in webserver programming, as part of my apprenticeship.

Before use, ensure your local port 8080 is not currently in use.
To run the server, execute the command 'lein run' from the terminal.
Direct your browser to 'http://localhost:8080/' and behold!

The response from the server will consist of the host name ('localhost'), the server port ('8080'), and the path of the request ('/' or '/whatever/you/want').

To terminate the server, type 'ctrl+c' in the same terminal.

## Usage

Anyone can use this as a learning tool. It's nothing fancy.
